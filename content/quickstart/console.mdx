Getting started with Unreal is as easy as it gets. You can create a production-ready API key in seconds—no setup, no code, just a few clicks.

## How to Generate an API Key

1. **Go to <a href={CONSOLE_URL} target="_blank">Unreal Console</a> and sign in (wallet or email).**
2. Click on the **API Keys** tab in the sidebar.
3. Hit **Generate Key** and optionally give it a name.
4. **Copy your new API key**—this is the only time you'll see the full key!
5. Paste it into your app or environment. You're ready to call the API.

> ⚡ **Tip:** You can generate, name, and revoke as many keys as you need for different projects or environments.

## Unreal Console
