>   <img src="/static/a-futuristic-city-floating-in-the-clouds--painted-in-pastel-tones_1_00.jpg" alt="Generated image preview" width="400" />
> </div>

## Request (curl)

```bash
curl -X POST {OPENAI_URL}/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "a futuristic city floating in the clouds, painted in pastel tones",
    "model": "unreal::playground-v2-5-1024px-aesthetic",
    "seed": 3
  }'
```

### Example response

```jsonc
{
  "data": [
    { "b64_json": "<base-64 image truncated for brevity>" }
  ]
}
```

Once you have the URL, you can embed or download the image as needed. Try adjusting `prompt`, `model`, or `steps` for different results.
