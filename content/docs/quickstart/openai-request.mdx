# Your first Chat Completion request


With an API key in hand, youâ€™re ready to call the Unreal OpenAI endpoint.

## Example (curl)

```bash
curl https://openai.unreal.art/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "unreal::llama4-scout-instruct-basic",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
  }'
```

Response should look like:

```jsonc
