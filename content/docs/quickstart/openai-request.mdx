# Your first Chat Completion request

> ðŸ“º _Video walkthrough coming soon._

With an API key in hand, youâ€™re ready to call the Unreal OpenAI endpoint.

## Example (curl)

```bash
curl {OPENAI_URL}/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "unreal::llama4-scout-instruct-basic",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
  }'
```

Response should look like:

```json {"id":"...","choices":[{"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Hi!"}}]}
```
