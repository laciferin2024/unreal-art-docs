# Generate an API key with Unreal Console

> ðŸ“º _Video walkthrough coming soon._

This quick-start shows how to create an API key that lets your application access the Unreal OpenAI backend.

## Prerequisites

- An Unreal account (wallet or email login)
- Access to `unreal-console` (link TBD)

## Steps

1. **Sign in** to `unreal-console` using your preferred authentication method.
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section in the sidebar.
3. Click **Generate Key**.
4. Choose the desired permissions / usage tier (defaults are fine for now).
5. Copy your new keyâ€”**this is the only time it will be shown in full**.
6. Store the key securely (e.g., environment variable or secret manager).

## Next

Head to the next quick-start to make your first chat completion request with the key you just generated.
